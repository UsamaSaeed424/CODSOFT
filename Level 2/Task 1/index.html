      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah[a] (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister,
        politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913
        until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general
        until his death. </p>
      <p>Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon
        his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
        eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first
        two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim
        unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which
        Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
        fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
        subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
        satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy. </p>
      <p>By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid
        the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim
        League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the
        Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the
        provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the
        Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British
        India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the
        independence of a Hindu-majority India, and for a predominantly Muslim state of Pakistan.</p>
      <p>As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies,
        and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India to Pakistan after the two
        states' independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in
        September 1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and
        respected legacy in Pakistan. Several universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. He is
        revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-e-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday
        is also observed as a national holiday in the country. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert, Jinnah
        remains Pakistan's greatest leader. </p>

      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <h3>Struggle For Pakistan</h3>
      <h4>Background to independence</h4>
      <p>Until the late 1930s, most Muslims of the British Raj expected, upon independence, to be part of a unitary
        state encompassing all of British India, as did the Hindus and others who advocated self-government.[93] Despite
        this, other nationalist proposals were being made. In a speech given at Allahabad to a League session in 1930,
        Sir Muhammad Iqbal called for a state for Muslims in British India. Choudhary Rahmat Ali published a pamphlet in
        1933 advocating a state "Pakistan" in the Indus Valley, with other names given to Muslim-majority areas
        elsewhere in India.[94] Jinnah and Iqbal corresponded in 1936 and 1937; in subsequent years, Jinnah credited
        Iqbal as his mentor, and used Iqbal's imagery and rhetoric in his speeches.[95]</p>
      <h4>Iqbal's influence on Jinnah</h4>
      <p>The well documented influence of Iqbal on Jinnah, with regard to taking the lead in creating Pakistan, has been
        described as "significant", "powerful" and even "unquestionable" by scholars.[102][103][104][105][106] Iqbal has
        also been cited as an influential force in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London and
        re-enter the politics of India.[107][108][109][110] Initially, however, Iqbal and Jinnah were opponents, as
        Iqbal believed Jinnah did not care about the crises confronting the Muslim community during the British Raj.
        According to Akbar S. Ahmed, this began to change during Iqbal's final years prior to his death in 1938. Iqbal
        gradually succeeded in converting Jinnah over to his view, who eventually accepted Iqbal as his "mentor". Ahmed
        comments that in his annotations to Iqbal's letters, Jinnah expressed solidarity with Iqbal's view: that Indian
        Muslims required a separate homeland.</p>
      <h4>Second World War and Lahore Resolution</h4>
      <p>On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain announced the commencement of war with Nazi
        Germany.[115] The following day, the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders,
        announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India. After
        meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended
        for the duration of the war.[116] The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate independence with a
        constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial governments resigned
        on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder of the war. Jinnah,
        on the other hand, was more willing to accommodate the British, and they in turn increasingly recognised him and
        the League as the representatives of India's Muslims.[117] Jinnah later stated, "after the war began, ... I was
        treated on the same basis as Mr Gandhi. I was wonderstruck why I was promoted and given a place side by side
        with Mr Gandhi."[118] Although the League did not actively support the British war effort, neither did they try
        to obstruct it.[119]</p>
      <h4>Postwar</h4>
      <p>Field Marshal Viscount Wavell succeeded Linlithgow as Viceroy in 1943. In June 1945, following the release of
        the Congress leaders, Wavell called for a conference, and invited the leading figures from the various
        communities to meet with him at Simla. He proposed a temporary government along the lines which Liaquat and
        Desai had agreed. However, Wavell was unwilling to guarantee that only the League's candidates would be placed
        in the seats reserved for Muslims. All other invited groups submitted lists of candidates to the Viceroy. Wavell
        cut the conference short in mid-July without further seeking an agreement; with a British general election
        imminent, Churchill's government did not feel it could proceed.[135] </p>
      <h4>Mountbatten and independence</h4>
      <p>On 20 February 1947, Attlee announced Mountbatten's appointment, and that Britain would transfer power in India
        not later than June 1948.[150] Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival
        in India.[151] By then, the Congress had come around to the idea of partition. Nehru stated in 1960, "the truth
        is that we were tired men and we were getting on in years ... The plan for partition offered a way out and we
        took it."[152] Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a
        future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at the centre which they desired.[153] However,
        the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be
        divided.[154] </p>
      <h4>Governor-General</h4>
      <p>The Radcliffe Commission, dividing Bengal and Punjab, completed its work and reported to Mountbatten on 12
        August; the last Viceroy held the maps until the 17th, not wanting to spoil the independence celebrations in
        both nations. There had already been ethnically charged violence and movement of populations; publication of the
        Radcliffe Line dividing the new nations sparked mass migration, murder, and ethnic cleansing. Many on the "wrong
        side" of the lines fled or were murdered, or murdered others, hoping to make facts on the ground which would
        reverse the commission's verdict. Radcliffe wrote in his report that he knew that neither side would be happy
        with his award; he declined his fee for the work.[171] Christopher Beaumont, Radcliffe's private secretary,
        later wrote that Mountbatten "must take the blame—though not the sole blame—for the massacres in the Punjab in
        which between 500,000 to a million men, women and children perished".[172] As many as 14.5 million people
        relocated between India and Pakistan during and after partition.2007 Jinnah did what he could for the eight
        million people who migrated to Pakistan; although by now over 70 and frail from lung ailments, he travelled
        across West Pakistan and personally supervised the provision of aid.[173] According to Ahmed, "What Pakistan
        needed desperately in those early months was a symbol of the state, one that would unify people and give them
        the courage and resolve to succeed."[174]</p>
